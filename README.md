/* This project is to recreate a small version of the classic text-based game Adventure.  You will need to add the following:

Add in else if statements to go in the directions of “s” for south and “e” for east, and an else statement that says “You can’t go in that direction”. Be creative and come up with different situations in each direction.

Add at least 5 other areas to your mini Adventure.  Each area should have options on where you can go or things you can do in that area (School appropriate :) )
