This project is to recreate a small version of the classic text-based game Adventure.  You will need to add the following:

- Add in else if statements to go in the directions of “s” for south and “e” for east
- An else statement that says “You can’t go in that direction” for directions that cannot be traveled.
- 5 additional areas with at least 2 options of actions
Be creative and come up with different situations in each direction.

Each area should have options on where you can go and/or things you can do in that area (School appropriate :) )
